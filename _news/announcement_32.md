Our tutorial titled "ML-Asset Management: Curation, Discovery, and Utilization" was accepted at the VLDB, 2025. It's a joint work with Case Western Reserve University and National University of Singapore. 
The tutorial will be held at London, UK in September, 2025. Thanks Mengying Wang for leading the effort!
