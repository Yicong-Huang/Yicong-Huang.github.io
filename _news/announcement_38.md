I have successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis titled ["UDF-Centric Dataflow Systems for Supporting User-Defined Functions in Collaborative Data Science, AI, and ML"](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9tv0t1tr). I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Chen Li, for his unwavering support and guidance throughout my Ph.D. journey. I am officially a Dr. now!
