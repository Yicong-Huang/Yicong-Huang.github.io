Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Software Engineer at Databricks Inc. and also serve as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMass Amherst.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Information Systems Group (ISG)](https://isg.ics.uci.edu), [Computer Science department, University of California, Irvine](https://ics.uci.edu), advised by [Dr. Chen Li](https://chenli.ics.uci.edu) .
My dissertation title is "UDF-Centric Dataflow Systems for Supporting User-Defined Functions in Collaborative Data Science, AI, and ML".
I received my B.S. in Computer Science from University of California, Irvine as well.

My research focuses on **big data management**, **data-processing systems**, and **machine learning systems**.
I take a systems-driven approach by co-designing the key components of modern data-intensive pipelines, including workflow engines, UDF debugging frameworks, pipelining optimizers, and machine learning acceleration systems for streaming data.
To optimize performance, usability, and scalability, I integrate techniques across data management, distributed systems, program analysis, and machine learning.

I have contributed extensively to the [Texera](https://texera.io) project ([Apache Incubating](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/texera.html)), a collaborative and interactive system for data science and AI/ML using workflows.
My research has been published in database venues such as SIGMOD ([Udon](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626712), [Pasta](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3698832), etc) and VLDB ([Texera](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3681954.3682022), [IcedTea](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3712221.3712251), [CORE](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p2032-yang.pdf), etc), and my interdisciplinary work spans venues including TOCHI, PNAS Nexus, JAMIA, AMIA, and PLOS ONE.

My research was recognized with a [SIGMOD 2024 Best Demo Runner-Up Award](https://sigmod.org/sigmod-awards/sigmod-best-demonstration-award/) and has been supported by fellowships including the [2025 Joseph & Dorothy Fischer Memorial Endowed Fellowship](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/impact/student-awards-honors/), the [2025 Beall Family Foundation Graduate Student Entrepreneur Award in Computer Science](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/impact/student-awards-honors/), the [2024 Graduate Deanâ€™s Dissertation Fellowship](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/impact/student-awards-honors/), and the [2023 Public Impact Fellowship](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/impact/student-awards-honors/).

I interned at Observe, ByteDance, VISA and Observe. I have also led collaborative research projects and mentored over 50 students across various levels.
