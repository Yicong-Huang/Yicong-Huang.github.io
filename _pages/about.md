Welcome to my personal website!

I currently serve as a Software Engineer at Databricks Inc. working on the Apache Spark team to advance one of
the fastest and most scalable data engines in the world. I also serve as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMass
Amherst.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from
the [Information Systems Group (ISG)](https://isg.ics.uci.edu), [Computer Science department, University of California, Irvine](https://ics.uci.edu),
advised by [Dr. Chen Li](https://chenli.ics.uci.edu) .
My dissertation title is "UDF-Centric Dataflow Systems for Supporting User-Defined Functions in Collaborative Data
Science, AI, and ML."
I received my B.S. in Computer Science from University of California, Irvine as well.

My research focuses on **big data management**, **data-processing systems**, and **machine learning systems**.
I take a systems-driven approach by co-designing the key components of modern data-intensive pipelines, including
workflow engines, UDF debugging frameworks, pipelining optimizers, and machine learning acceleration systems for
streaming data.
To optimize performance, usability, and scalability, I integrate techniques across data management, distributed systems,
program analysis, and machine learning.

I have contributed extensively to the [Apache Texera (Incubating)](https://apache.texera.io) project, a collaborative
and interactive system for data science and AI/ML using workflows.
My research has been published in database venues such as SIGMOD, VLDB and ICDE, and my interdisciplinary work spans
venues including TOCHI, PNAS Nexus, JAMIA, AMIA, and PLOS ONE.

My research was recognized with
a [SIGMOD 2024 Best Demo Runner-Up Award](https://sigmod.org/sigmod-awards/sigmod-best-demonstration-award/) and has
been supported by fellowships including
the [2025 Joseph & Dorothy Fischer Memorial Endowed Fellowship](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/impact/student-awards-honors/),
the [2025 Beall Family Foundation Graduate Student Entrepreneur Award in Computer Science](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/impact/student-awards-honors/),
the [2024 Graduate Dean’s Dissertation Fellowship](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/impact/student-awards-honors/), and
the [2023 Public Impact Fellowship](https://ics.uci.edu/academics/impact/student-awards-honors/).
I also received
a [2025 Most Promising Future Faculty Award](https://dtei.uci.edu/uci-teach-day/celebration-of-teaching/) at 33rd UCI
Teach Day.

I have interned at Observe, ByteDance, VISA and Observe. I have also led collaborative research projects and mentored
over 50 students across various levels.
