Welcome to my personal website!

I currently serve as a Software Engineer at Databricks Inc. working on the Apache Spark team to advance one of
the fastest and most scalable data engines in the world. I also serve as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at UMass
Amherst.

My research focuses on **big data management**, **data-processing systems**, and **machine learning systems**.
I take a systems-driven approach by co-designing the key components of modern data-intensive pipelines, including
workflow engines, UDF debugging frameworks, pipelining optimizers, and machine learning acceleration systems for
streaming data.
To optimize performance, usability, and scalability, I integrate techniques across data management, distributed systems,
program analysis, and machine learning.

I have contributed extensively to the [Apache Texera (Incubating)](https://apache.texera.io) project, a collaborative
and interactive system for data science and AI/ML using workflows.
My research has been published in database venues such as SIGMOD, VLDB and ICDE, and my interdisciplinary work spans
venues including TOCHI, PNAS Nexus, JAMIA, AMIA, and PLOS ONE.
